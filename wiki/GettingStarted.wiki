#summary Getting Started

= Introduction =

SKPSMTPMessage is a quick and dirty class which implements a basic SMTP client for the iPhone. If you just want to post a plain text or HTML message on the iPhone, use {{{-[UIApplication openURL:]}}} (these are not the droids you're looking for, move along, move along). However, if you're trying to attach a file to an email, or do other crazy stuff, you'll want to use this class.

= Integration with your App =

Add the NSStream+SKPSMTPExtensions.[m|h] and SKPSMTPMessage.[m|h] classes to your project. Refer to SMTPSenderAppDelegate.m for a quick example of how to use the class.

I'll document this code using Doxygen soon. Until then, feel free to email me at ibaird -at- gmail -dot- com for more info.
